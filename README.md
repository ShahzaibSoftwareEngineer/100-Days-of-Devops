### My 100 Days of DevOps Challenge Journey

I'm currently undertaking the **100 Days of DevOps Challenge** by KodeKloud. This program is a hands-on journey designed to build practical skills in key DevOps technologies. Each day, I tackle a new concept, from foundational tools to advanced orchestration.

By completing this challenge, I'm building proficiency in:

* **Linux & Shell Scripting:** This is the foundation of DevOps. I'm learning to use the command line to automate tasks, manage files, and control servers. Itâ€™s about making routine work fast and repeatable.

* **Git & Version Control:** I'm using Git to track changes to my code and project files. This allows me to collaborate with others, revert to previous versions if something goes wrong, and keep a clear history of my work.

* **Docker & Containerization:** I'm using Docker to package applications and their dependencies into a single, isolated container. This ensures that an application works the same way everywhere, whether on my laptop or a production server.

* **Kubernetes:** After using Docker to create containers, I'm using Kubernetes to manage and orchestrate them at scale. It automatically handles things like deploying new versions, scaling up or down, and ensuring applications stay available.

* **CI/CD (Jenkins):** I'm building pipelines with Jenkins to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying my applications. This helps me deliver new code faster and more reliably.

* **Ansible:** I'm learning to use Ansible for configuration management. It allows me to define the desired state of a server or system in a simple file, and Ansible makes it a reality. This is key for managing a fleet of servers consistently.

* **Terraform:** I'm using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Instead of manually setting up cloud resources, I'm writing code to provision my infrastructure. This makes my environments repeatable, scalable, and easy to manage.
