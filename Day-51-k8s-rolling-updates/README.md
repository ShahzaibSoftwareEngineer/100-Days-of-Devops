# Day 51: Execute Rolling Updates in Kubernetes

## üìò What is a Rolling Update?

A Rolling Update is the default deployment strategy in Kubernetes. It ensures your application is updated gradually without downtime by replacing old Pods with new ones step by step.

## üîë Key Concepts

Zero Downtime: Your application keeps running while the update happens.

Gradual Replacement: New Pods are created one at a time (or in batches) while old Pods are terminated only after the new ones are ready.

Controlled Speed: Parameters like maxUnavailable and maxSurge let you control how many Pods are replaced or added at once.

Safe Rollouts: If something goes wrong, you can roll back to the previous stable version.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Use Rolling Updates?

Ensures high availability during deployments.

Prevents service outages caused by taking down all Pods at once.

Allows for smooth version upgrades (e.g., updating app v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1).

Provides an easy way to test new releases safely before fully rolling them out.

## Simple Explain

**Problem**: Your app runs on 3 pods with nginx:1.16, but you need nginx:1.17
**Old Way**: Stop all 3 pods ‚Üí Start 3 new pods (Service down!)
**Rolling Update**: Replace 1 pod at a time (Service stays up!)

## Lab Scenario

- **Current**: nginx-deployment with nginx:1.16
- **Goal**: Update to nginx:1.17
- **Requirement**: Zero downtime

## Step 1: Check Current State

```bash
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment
```
Output:
```
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           6m5s
```

```bash
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```
Key info:
- Current image: `nginx:1.16`
- Container name: `nginx-container`
- Pods labeled: `app=nginx-app`

## Step 2: Execute Rolling Update

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.17
```

## Step 3: Monitor the Update

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

Watch pods change:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx-app --watch
```

```

## Step 4: Verify Success

```bash
# Check all pods are updated
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx-app

# Confirm new image version
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
```

## Key Rolling Update Settings

From our lab deployment:
- **MaxUnavailable**: 25% (can lose 1 pod during update)
- **MaxSurge**: 25% (can have 1 extra pod during update)
- **Strategy**: RollingUpdate (gradual replacement)

## Common Lab Mistakes

1. **Wrong label selector**:
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå Wrong
   kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
   
   # ‚úÖ Correct (check your deployment labels)
   kubectl get pods -l app=nginx-app
   ```

2. **Wrong container name**:
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå Wrong
   kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.17
   
   # ‚úÖ Correct (check describe output)
   kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.17
   ```

## Essential Commands for Lab

```bash
# 1. Check current deployment
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment

# 2. Execute rolling update
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.17

# 3. Monitor progress
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

# 4. Verify pods updated
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx-app

# 5. Emergency rollback (if needed)
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

## Why Rolling Updates Matter

- **Zero Downtime**: Users can access your app during updates
- **Safe Updates**: If new version fails, old pods still serve traffic
- **Gradual Process**: Problems affect only some pods, not all
- **Easy Rollback**: Can quickly return to previous version

## Lab Success Criteria

‚úÖ All 3 pods running nginx:1.17  
‚úÖ No service interruption during update  
‚úÖ Deployment shows "3/3" ready status  
‚úÖ Update completed without errors

Rolling updates make deployments safe and reliable your users stay happy while you upgrade your applications!
