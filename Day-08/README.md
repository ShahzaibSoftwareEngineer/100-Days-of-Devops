Today, I set up **Ansible v4.10.0** on the Jump Host to start exploring configuration management and automation tasks. Ansible was chosen for its **agentless design** and **minimal setup**, making it ideal for managing multiple servers efficiently.

## 📖 What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that helps teams automate:

- **Configuration management** – maintain consistent environments.
- **Application deployment** – deploy code across servers automatically.
- **Orchestration** – coordinate tasks across multiple nodes.
- **Task automation** – reduce repetitive work and human errors.

**Advantages of Ansible:**

- Agentless – no software required on target servers.
- SSH-based communication – uses SSH for Linux/Unix, WinRM for Windows.
- Idempotent – ensures consistent results even after multiple runs.
- YAML Playbooks – human-readable automation scripts.
- Extensible – supports custom modules and plugins.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Commands Performed

### Step 1: Check Python & pip
```bash
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
````

> Verified Python 3.9.18 and pip 24.0 are installed.

### Step 2: Install Ansible v4.10.0 (user installation)

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible==4.10.0
```

> Installed Ansible in the **user environment** as sudo access was not available.

### Step 3: Add Ansible to PATH

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

> Makes the Ansible binary accessible in any terminal session for the current user.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
which ansible
ansible --version
```

> Installation confirmed: `~/.local/bin/ansible`
> Version: 4.10.0 (ansible-core 2.11.12)

### Step 5: Test Ansible

```bash
ansible localhost -m ping
```

> Output `pong` confirms Ansible is working and ready to manage nodes.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Ansible is **easy to install using pip3** without root access.
* User-level installation works perfectly when sudo is unavailable.
* The Jump Host is now ready to **orchestrate tasks across multiple servers**.
